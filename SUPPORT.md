## How to file issues and get help  

This project uses [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/microsoft/woodgrove-groceries/issues) to track bugs and feature requests. Please search the existing 
issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates.  For new issues or questions about using this project, please file your bug or 
feature request as a [new Issue](https://github.com/microsoft/woodgrove-groceries/issues/new?template=Blank+issue).

## Using the source code

The objective of this project is to demonstrate various authentication user experiences. While it is possible to download and run the app locally, it's not recommended because the app is designed to support multiple flows within a single application, whereas a typical app utilizes a single sign-in flow. 

Examples of Microsoft Entra External ID are available at <https://aka.ms/eeid/samples>. For these examples, we provide instructions on how to download and use the samples or create your own application based on common authentication and authorization scenarios, development languages, and platforms.
